These aren't formal notes related to the course and henceforward there is \emph{absolutely no guarantee} that the recorded material is in correspondence with the course expectations, or that these notes lack any mistakes.\\
In fact, there probably are mistakes in the notes! I would highly appreciate if any comments or corrections were sent to me via email at \href{mailto:tzorani.elad@gmail.com}{tzorani.elad@gmail.com}.\\
